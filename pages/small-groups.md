## What Are Small Groups?

Small groups are one of the heartbeats of The Well Church. They are smaller gatherings of people — usually 8 to 15 — who meet regularly to study the Bible, pray together, and support one another through life.

While our Sunday gatherings are a wonderful time to worship together as a larger family, small groups are where deeper relationships are built. They meet throughout the week in homes and other venues across Reading.

## Why Join a Small Group?

Being part of a small group is one of the best ways to put down roots at The Well. Here's what many of our members say they value most:

- **Friendships** — Getting to know people well, not just on a Sunday morning
- **Growth** — Studying the Bible together and learning from one another
- **Support** — Having people around you in the ups and downs of life
- **Study** — Going deeper into Scripture in a conversational setting
- **Prayer** — Praying together and seeing God at work

## Find a Group

We want everyone at The Well to be part of a small group. Whether you're brand new to the church or you've been coming for years, there is a group for you.

Groups are available at different times and in different locations to suit a range of schedules and needs.

[Get in touch](/contact/) to find out more about current small groups and which one might be the right fit for you.
