Watch the Sunday morning service from The Well Church in Reading, recorded on 28 January 2026.

We gather every Sunday at 10:30am at Dawlish Road, Reading, RG2 7SD — a multicultural, welcoming community of believers in south Reading. Every service is live-streamed on Facebook for those who cannot join us in person.

The Well Church is a growing congregation rooted in the community of south Reading. Our Sunday gatherings combine heartfelt worship, prayer, and practical Bible teaching. We are currently in a series on **Building Character Like Jesus**, exploring the qualities of Christ that we are each called to grow in — diligence, compassion, self-control, and more.
