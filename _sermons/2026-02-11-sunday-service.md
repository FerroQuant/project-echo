Watch the Sunday morning service from The Well Church in Reading, recorded on 11 February 2026.

We meet every Sunday at 10:30am at Dawlish Road, Reading, RG2 7SD. Every service is live-streamed on Facebook — friends from across the UK and around the world join us online each week.

The Well Church is a growing, multicultural family of believers in south Reading. We believe in the power of gathered worship and prayer, and our ongoing teaching series — **Building Character Like Jesus** — explores practical, Bible-rooted themes to equip and encourage everyday faith.
