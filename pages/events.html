            We periodically set aside seasons of fasting and prayer as a church family.
            Rooted in 2 Chronicles 20:1&ndash;37, we believe that when God&#8217;s people seek him together,
            he acts. Watch our Facebook page for announcements about upcoming fasting and prayer periods.
