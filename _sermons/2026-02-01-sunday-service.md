Watch the Sunday morning service from The Well Church in Reading, recorded on 1 February 2026 — one of our most-watched recent services.

We meet every Sunday at 10:30am at Dawlish Road, Reading, RG2 7SD. Services are live-streamed on Facebook every week — friends from Liberia, West Africa, and across the UK join us online regularly.

The Well Church is a vibrant, multicultural family of believers in south Reading. Our teaching is grounded in Scripture and speaks to real, everyday life. Our current series — **Building Character Like Jesus** — is drawing people in both in person and online, exploring what it means to grow in faith and character week by week.
