## Our Story

The Well Church began as a small, growing group of ordinary people who encountered God and wanted to share that with their community in Reading. We believe that church isn't a building — it's people, doing life together and pointing one another toward Jesus.

Over the years we have grown from a handful of friends meeting in homes to a vibrant, multi-cultural congregation rooted in the south of Reading. Our name reflects what we believe: that Jesus is the source of living water, and that anyone who is thirsty is welcome here.

## Our Vision

We exist to bring hope, community, and transformation to the people of Reading and beyond. We want to see lives changed, families restored, and a community built on love, faith, and service.

## Our Values

- **Welcome** — Every person matters. Everyone is welcome, exactly as they are.
- **Community** — We are better together. We do life in relationship with one another.
- **Faith** — We trust in Jesus Christ and seek to grow in our relationship with him.
- **Service** — We are called to love and serve our neighbours, our city, and the world.
- **Growth** — We encourage every person to grow spiritually, relationally, and in character.

## Leadership

The Well Church is led by a team of elders and staff who are passionate about the church and its mission. Our leaders are committed to serving the congregation and the wider community.
