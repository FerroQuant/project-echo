## About The Well Centre

The Well Centre is the social action arm of The Well Church, formerly known as The Restoration Centre. We exist to serve the wider community of Reading with practical help, a listening ear, and a warm welcome.

The Well Centre is **open to everybody regardless of religion, background or belief**. You don't need to be part of the church to access our services or to get involved as a volunteer. We simply want to love and serve our neighbours.

## What We Offer

### Community Support

We offer a range of practical support services for people in the local area, including signposting to other organisations and helping people navigate the support available to them.

### A Welcoming Space

Our doors are open. Whether you need somewhere to sit, a cup of tea, or someone to talk to, you are welcome here.

### Volunteering

We rely on volunteers to make everything we do possible. If you'd like to give your time and skills, we'd love to hear from you. No experience is necessary — just a willingness to help.

### Practical Help

We offer practical assistance to individuals and families who are facing difficult times. This may include help with food, clothing, household items, or other needs. Please get in touch to find out more.

## Get Involved

Whether you need support or you want to offer it, The Well Centre is here for you.
