## About The Well Centre

The Well Centre is the social action arm of The Well Church, based at Dawlish Road in Reading. We exist to serve the wider community with practical help, a listening ear, and a genuinely warm welcome — no strings attached.

**The Well Centre is open to everybody**, regardless of faith, background, or belief. You do not need to be part of the church to access our services or to get involved as a volunteer. We simply want to love and serve our neighbours.

## What We Offer

### Community Support

We offer practical support to people in the local area, including signposting to other organisations and helping people navigate the help available to them. If you are not sure where to start, come and talk to us.

We work closely with refugees and asylum seekers in Reading, helping with integration, language barriers, and the practical challenges of starting life in a new country. We also partner with a vibrant Amharic-speaking congregation, providing a spiritual home for the Ethiopian and Eritrean community in our area.

### A Welcoming Space

Our doors are open. Whether you need somewhere to sit, a cup of tea, or someone to talk to, you are welcome here. We believe that sometimes what people need most is simply to be received with kindness.

### Practical Help

We offer practical assistance to individuals and families going through difficult times — whether that is help with food, clothing, household items, or other needs. Please get in touch to find out what we can offer.

### Volunteering

Everything we do is made possible by volunteers. If you would like to give your time and skills, we would love to hear from you. No experience is necessary — just a willingness to show up and help.
