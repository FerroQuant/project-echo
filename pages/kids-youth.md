## Kids at The Well

We love children and believe they are a vital part of our church family. We want every child to encounter God in a way that is age-appropriate, fun, and genuinely meaningful.

During our Sunday morning services, we run children's activities for different age groups so that children can learn and worship in an environment designed just for them — while parents engage fully in the service.

Our children's team is DBS-checked and trained to provide a safe, nurturing environment for every child. We follow robust safeguarding policies to ensure all children and young people in our care are protected.

**Age groups catered for:**

- Babies and toddlers (0–3 years) — a safe and supervised crèche space
- Pre-school children (3–5 years) — play-based learning and Bible stories
- Primary age (5–11 years) — interactive activities, craft, games, and teaching

## Youth

Our youth ministry is for young people in secondary school (ages 11–18). We believe in investing in the next generation — helping them discover who they are in Christ and how their faith connects to everyday life.

Youth activities include Sunday morning groups, social events, and opportunities to serve the wider community.
