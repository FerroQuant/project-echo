## Why Give?

Generosity is at the heart of what we believe. Everything we have is a gift from God, and giving is one of the ways we express our gratitude and our trust in him.

Your giving makes a real difference. It enables us to run our Sunday services, invest in children's and youth ministry, support The Well Centre's community work, and reach out to our neighbours in Reading.

No gift is too small. Every contribution — whatever its size — is received with genuine gratitude.

## How to Give

We would love for giving to be simple and straightforward. To receive our bank details for a regular standing order or a one-off bank transfer, please [get in touch](/contact/) and we'll send them to you directly.

If you are a UK taxpayer, please consider **Gift Aid** — it allows us to reclaim 25p for every £1 you give, at no extra cost to you. Just let us know when you get in touch.
