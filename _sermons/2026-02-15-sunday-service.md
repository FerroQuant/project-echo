Watch the full Sunday morning service from The Well Church in Reading, recorded on 15 February 2026. This was one of our longer gatherings — 49 minutes of worship, teaching, and prayer together as a family.

We gather every Sunday at 10:30am at Dawlish Road, Reading, RG2 7SD — and every service is live-streamed on Facebook for friends joining from across the UK and around the world.

The Well Church is a vibrant, multicultural community in south Reading. Our Sunday teaching is grounded in Scripture and applied to real life. We are currently exploring **Building Character Like Jesus** — a series on what it looks like to grow in the qualities that defined Jesus himself: diligence, compassion, self-control, and joy.
