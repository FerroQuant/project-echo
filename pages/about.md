## Welcome

> "Jesus stood up and shouted, 'If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!'"
> — John 7:37

That invitation is at the heart of everything we are. We are a church for the thirsty — for people who are searching, who are hurting, who are curious, or who are simply looking for a place to belong. Whatever has brought you here, you are welcome.

## Our Story

The Well Church is a congregation rooted in south Reading, meeting on Dawlish Road. We began as a small group of people who had encountered God and wanted to share that with their neighbours and their city. Over time we have grown into a vibrant, multicultural family of believers — people from many different nations, backgrounds, and walks of life, gathered together around one name: Jesus.

Our name comes from John 7:37. We believe that Jesus is the source of living water, and that his invitation is open to everyone. That has shaped how we welcome people, how we pray, and how we live.

## Who We Are

We are a multicultural family of believers. On any given Sunday you will hear accents from across Reading, from across the UK, and from across the world. We have been encouraged and humbled by the reach of our community — from our neighbours in RG2 to friends following along from Liberia, West Africa, and beyond. The gospel has always crossed borders, and we are grateful to be part of something bigger than our own postcode.

We are also a community that takes character seriously. Our ongoing series, **Building Character Like Jesus**, explores what it looks like to grow in diligence, compassion, self-control, and joy — not as a checklist, but as a daily, lived-out following of Jesus. These short daily devotionals are shared on our Facebook page and have become part of the rhythm of many people's week.

## Our Values

- **Community** — We do life together. Church is not a service you attend; it is a family you belong to.
- **Worship** — We gather to glorify God through song, prayer, and the preaching of his Word.
- **Prayer** — We believe prayer changes things. Fasting and prayer are woven into our calendar, not added on as an afterthought.
- **Outreach** — The love of God is not meant to stay inside four walls. We reach out to our neighbours, our city, and the world.
- **Growth** — We encourage every person to grow — in faith, in character, and in their relationship with God and one another.

## Community Impact

The Well Church is not just a place of worship — it is a place of practical action. Through The Well Centre, we serve some of the most vulnerable people in our community:

- **Refugee support and integration** — We walk alongside refugees and asylum seekers as they rebuild their lives in Reading, offering practical help, friendship, and a sense of belonging.
- **Emergency assistance** — We provide food, clothing, household items, and other essentials to individuals and families in crisis.
- **Amharic-speaking congregation** — We partner with a thriving Amharic-speaking congregation, creating a welcoming spiritual home for the Ethiopian and Eritrean community in Reading.
- **Multicultural integration** — Our church brings together people from many nations and backgrounds, building genuine community across cultural lines.

This work is at the heart of who we are. We believe the love of God is meant to be given away — and we are committed to reaching our neighbours with practical compassion.

## A Church With Roots and Reach

We are a local church with a global heart. We meet at Dawlish Road in Reading, and we care deeply about this neighbourhood. Our services are live-streamed on Facebook every Sunday — and we are working towards launching on YouTube too, so you will be able to find us wherever you watch. Our community extends far beyond Reading — whether you are joining us in person or watching from another country, you are part of the family.
