## Service Times

We meet every Sunday morning and would love to welcome you.

**Sunday Morning — 10:30am**

Our Sunday gathering is a time to worship together, hear from the Bible, and encourage one another in faith. All are welcome.

## What to Expect

When you arrive you'll be greeted by one of our welcome team who can show you around and answer any questions. A typical Sunday morning looks like this:

- **Welcome & Greeting** — A friendly welcome from our team
- **Worship** — Contemporary sung worship together
- **Teaching** — A message from the Bible, applied to everyday life
- **Prayer** — Space to pray and be prayed for
- **Fellowship** — Tea, coffee, and conversation after the service

The gathering lasts around 90 minutes. Come as you are — there is no dress code.

## Children

We love welcoming families. Children's activities run during the Sunday service for babies, toddlers, and primary-school-age children, so little ones can learn and grow in a fun and safe environment. Please speak to one of our team when you arrive and we'll get your children settled in.
