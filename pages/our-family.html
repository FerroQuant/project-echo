      We are better together. The Well Church is part of a wider family of churches and ministries
      in Reading and beyond. These are the people we walk with, learn from, and serve alongside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The church was never meant to work alone. We believe that the body of Christ is made up of many
      parts — different congregations, different expressions, different gifts — and that when we
      stand together we are stronger. Our partner churches and ministries share our love for Jesus,
      our heart for people, and our commitment to the city of Reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are grateful for every relationship in this network. Some of these partnerships go back many
      years; others are newer friendships built on a shared vision. All of them reflect our conviction
      that the kingdom of God is bigger than any one church, and that we are called to walk humbly
      and generously with those around us.
