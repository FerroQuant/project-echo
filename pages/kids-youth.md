## Kids at The Well

Children are not an afterthought at The Well — they are a full and cherished part of our church family. We believe that faith begins early, and we want every child who walks through our doors to feel genuinely welcomed, known, and cared for.

During our Sunday morning services, we run age-appropriate activities for children so that they can learn, ask questions, and grow in faith in an environment designed just for them — while parents and carers engage fully in the service.

Our children's team is DBS-checked and committed to providing a safe, nurturing, and fun space for every child. We take safeguarding seriously, and all children and young people in our care are protected by robust policies.

**Age groups:**

- **Babies and toddlers (0–3)** — A supervised and safe crèche space
- **Pre-school (3–5)** — Play-based learning and Bible stories
- **Primary age (5–11)** — Interactive teaching, craft, games, and conversation

## Youth

Our youth ministry is for young people in secondary school (ages 11–18). We want to invest in the next generation — to help them discover who they are, grow in their faith, and connect with one another in a community that genuinely cares about them.

Youth activities include Sunday morning groups, social events, and opportunities to serve the wider community together.

## A Family-Friendly Church

The Well Church is a place where families are genuinely welcome. We are a multicultural community, and we love the energy and joy that children bring. Whether you are a young family visiting for the first time or you have been coming for years, we want your whole family to feel at home here.
