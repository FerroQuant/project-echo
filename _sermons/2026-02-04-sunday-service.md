Watch the Sunday morning service from The Well Church in Reading, recorded on 4 February 2026.

We meet every Sunday at 10:30am at Dawlish Road, Reading, RG2 7SD — and we live-stream every service on Facebook for people who cannot be there in person.

The Well Church is a multicultural community church in south Reading, bringing together people from many nations and backgrounds. Our Sunday teaching is practical and Bible-rooted. Our series **Building Character Like Jesus** explores themes of diligence, compassion, self-control, and joy — character traits we see in Jesus and are called to grow in ourselves.
